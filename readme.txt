This is a small android mobile application project. 
Detecting user's current location for various different purpose is not a big deal for android users now.
In this project I have tried to develope a small application which detects current user's location and
keep on relocating user on change of current location. Also the application displays address when touched on the 
mobile screen.

To use or develope more on this application following things are needed:
1.Eclipse for android developers
2.Download all the libraries (To do so go through http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
3. As the project uses google maps we will need a API key from google to access Google map api 
 and its various java classes (To do so go through http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/location/index.html)
4. The application wont't run on android emulator as it will just display map wont be able to detect user
so run the application which will generate .apk file which you will have to install in andoid mobile phones
to test the application.

All the best. Use the code to develope more on it with different and creative ideas.
